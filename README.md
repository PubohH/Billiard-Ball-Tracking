The opticalflow method requires that you find the feature pixel's coordinate. The code is hard-coded with the coordinate of the cue ball in video clip "jumpshot_no_collision".

The HSV method requires that you click 10 times on the ball you want to track, ideally evenly across the ball you wish to track. Sometimes you might need to repeat this clicking process to get good tracking results. Adjusting sens also helps.
